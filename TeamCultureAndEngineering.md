# Culture and Engineering

## Culture
### Agile manifesto
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan


### Creating good culture 
What do we mean is a good culture?
Refernces 
* DevOps culture mebtions CALMS
* Culture, Automation, Lean, Measure, Sharing - CALMS
* Beliefs Principes and Values
* Karl Weigers - Creating a sofware Engineering Culture
* Managment Foester an environment
* Westrum Model of Organistional CUlture - Pathalogical, Buercratic, Genertaive
* Team Topologies - Mathew Skelton

### Observations in Pricing
#### Habits
* Default behaviour
* Patterns of behaviour bred from process driven dvelopemnet
* Many very smart people collectivly ineffective.
* Standups, Restrospectives, Big Agile, Epic Forest

### Breaking the habits
Focus on Goals and Outcomes rather than process and mechanisms

What can we do to shift?
* Clear on the Goals
* Automation
* Development collaboartion 
* Eliminate very long Peer Reviewing times 
* Team buy in at core
* You can't buy in from some other team
* Priority driven development doesn't understand bigger picture
* Open communication business to all connected parts of delivery
* Sit with the business
* Sit with other groups mix together at all levels escpecislly when doig a large project

Throw out
* Technical stories
* Task based planning
* Specification
* Prescriptive standardization
* Buracractic Culture

Bring in
* State what the user wants
* User Requirements
* Fast Feedback
* Incremental deliver
* Quality Assurance fo everyone
* You build it you run it
* Generative Culture
* Pair Programming
* Trunk based
* Pipeline cooperation between teams

### Project strategies
Big projects - Collaboration at high level between deptaments done by technical people to solve technical challenges


## Engineering

Has to be recognized - Pricing are at the sharp end of delivering prices quickly, to a vey wide audience capacity and in a short latency.
C++ has been used to give the ability for hgh perfomance and capacity
Most of the focus in IG is around client facing system and tradionally has taken all the time and efforts in developing infrastructore and operastion around this

Pricing Teams have got very high degrees of craft when it comes to c++
Unity has a good pakage mangemnet for c++
Teams usually have lots of Unit Tests
QA is involved expescally with usnit on testing the perfomance and integration
In the past and still is a habit of writting the test after the code this is improving escpecially in Unity
The code sofistication and best pratcices in c++ is high in all teams
Teams are struggling to get focus to move away from Jenkins (as it just works, well barely works) to GitLab - This is because of PiS
Unity has already got piplienes which work all the way up to releasing onto the package managment in artifactory
Feature feature has been inhibitive to the transfomationally task to move aaway from old code and devel pakages
Invision which are extremly difficult to chnage

CORBA is difficut to chnag e due to lack of expertise even in the wider (outside IG) community
Architecture have set a plan which has been awaiting focus fora few years.
Principle Engineering and Tech specialists could help forge the proofs and POC to gudie the tech that can transform:
Speed of develeopemt
Speed the transport of messgaes i.e latency
Observability adoption
Obseravabilty exists in Pricing - Is comprehensive and has existed for a good number of years
Incorrect perception that Pricing, Market Maing and Exposure have low Obseravability
Just beacuase they are not all using the new SaaS obseravbility platform
Generating SLO and SLA
Had to be developed with high performacne in mind and has evolved to use its own grfana and influx metrics db
SaaS grafana and metrics platform definitly does not fulfil the hight perfomance metric gathering and recording and granlarity that Pricing has currently got with the self maintained
